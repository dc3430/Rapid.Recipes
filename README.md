In my spare time, I enjoy cooking and some may say it's a stress reliever. I don't follow recipes this frustrates my wife. After a hard day of coding trying to figure out what to eat can be the hardest task of the day. This is why I chose to create this app. I wanted quick and easy ideas for recipes to make for my self or my family. When I deploy this app I hope that the user will get the same satisfaction out of the app as I do.
