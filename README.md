# Rapid.Recipes - An app to find recipe quick and easy!

- [] Getting Started: In this section include the link to your deployed app and any instructions you deem important.

- [X] <Your app title>: A description of your app. Background info of the game is a nice touch.
1. When you click on the link to Rapid Recipes you will be asked to log in.
2. Then you will be directed to categories of recipes from breakfast, lunch, dinner or even Create your recipe.
3. Once you make a choice you will be directed to the page with the recipe and ingredients on it.
4. This is where the real fun starts and you get to cook your meal.
5. My recommendation would be to first check the ingredients to see if you need to go to the grocery store.
6. Follow the recipe and enjoy your meal.

In my spare time, I enjoy cooking and some may say it's a stress reliever. I don't follow recipes this frustrates my wife. After a hard day of coding trying to figure out what to eat can be the hardest task of the day. This is why I chose to create this app. I wanted quick and easy ideas for recipes to make for my self or my family. When I deploy this app I hope that the user will get the same satisfaction out of the app as I do.
